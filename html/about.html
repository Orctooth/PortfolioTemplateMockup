            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span> am a games computing graduate currently participating in the scion scheme web development course with Netmatters. While I've yet to start my first professional position in games or web development, I have already learned a great deal of programming and design techniques in both practices, and my aim is to continue building upon these skills.</p>
            <p>Outside of the work world I like to unwind by playing interesting indie games and from time to time I will participate in game jams. I also like to tinker around with chiptune composition using tools based off of old games console sound kits.</p>
            <p>My experiences with programming cover the use of C#, C++, JavaScript and Python. My markup language toolset includes HTML, CSS and SASS. I am also experienced in using Unity Game Engine for games development. I graduated from university last year with a 2:2 bachelor's degree in games computing.</p>
